# JavaPomodoroTimer
 Basic Java based Pomodoro timer. I have found using these timers really helps get through the workday but there are a couple of changes I would like to add. For example, if I am working on a really important project I find that I need to skip a break or two to finish a task. I would like to add an override feature to skip the next break or two. 

Initially this is a simple command line run program, but would eventually like to develop into a webapp, add a GUI, etc.
